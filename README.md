<h2> Project Description: </h2>
The website should function as a public forum with user interaction. In a way, it is meant to simulate the core functionalities of a website like Reddit. Users will engage in a main forum by accessing user-created content in the form of posts. Most of the interaction will be limited to comments under each post. A user can also access the website with administrator privileges if their account is an admin. This will allow administrators to monitor the website.
