# COSC 360: Page Discussion
Discussion for each proposed page in our project. The style of all the pages involve a dark theme. Further design may include a toggle to the dark theme, improving accessibility.
>## Account Page
The Account Page is the page that contains all the user's information. The page contains the user's profile picture, username, first name, last name and the number of posts they've made. The page provides an option to edit profile information as well. The page also provides a collapsing sidebar navigation to switch pages and a header navigation to the home page, messaging, search posts and notifications.
>## Create Account
The Create Account is the page the user goes to when they wish to create an account for the website. The site asks for a first name, last name, user name, birthday, email and password. The page then validates the form by ensuring that the user re-enters the password. The form also shows an alert if any of the fields are empty. If all the fields are in order, the page would then go to the Home Page.
>## Home Page
The Home Page is homefront of the site. The Home Page is split into 2 columns. The left column contains the different topic boards a user can access by clicking on their topic of interest. The right column holds the posts of the selected topic board. The column is scrollable to see post chronologically. The Home Page header contains links to the "Home Page" and a link to the user's "Account Page".
>## Log In Page
The Log In page is the page where the user logs into the site to access more features. The page contains a username and password field as well as a submit button and a "Create Account" button. Clicking the "Create Account" button sends the user to the "Create Account" page.
>## Post Page
The Post Page is accessed by the user from the "Home Page" when they click on a post. The page enlarges the post and shows any comments made by other users under the post. The page still offers access to the topic boards in the left column.
